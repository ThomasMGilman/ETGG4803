ETGG 4803 Artificial Intelligence Bridge Problem
* N number of people need to get across a bridge that is covered in holes and it is dark
* There is only one flashlight and the people can only travel in pairs of Two
* The people travelling across the bridge can only go as fast as the slowest of the two
* The flashlight cannot be thrown back over the bridge and must be walked back to the other side
* What is the most optimal time to get everyone across the bridge

Example:
    A = 10
    B = 5
    C = 2
    D = 1

    Solution:
        C and D go across.                      Time Taken = 2 min's
        D takes flashlight back across bridge.  Time Taken = 1 min
        A and B go across.                      Time Taken = 10 min's
        C takes flashlight back across bridge.  Time Taken = 2 min's
        C and D go across.                      Time Taken = 2 min's
        All people are across bridge            Totel Time Taken = 17 min's
