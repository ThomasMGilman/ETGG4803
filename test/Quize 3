Question 1: WRONG not 0.83%
	Seven envelopes are placed randomly at each seat position of a round table that can be easily rotated. 
	Each envelope contains the name of one of seven people. 
	Each envelope contains exactly one name and each person's name is in one of the envelopes.
	The seven people each take a seat at the table in front of one of the envelopes. 
	If at least two people are seated in front of the envelope containing their name, all seven people win The Prize. 
	If not, they are permitted to rotate the table as much as they like, so long as they not change the relative order of the envelopes on the table. 
	If they are successful in matching two of the people and their envelopes, then the group still wins.
	Suppose at the start that none of the seven people are seated in front of the correct envelope. 
	What is the probability that the group can win The Prize?
	
	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
	[1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6]


Question 2: WRONG not a: 50% b: 30%
	Percentage chance per bowl pick one green marble without looking.
	Bowl 1:
		1 Red
		3 green
		2 blue
	Percentage chance: 3 / 6 = 50%
		
	Bowl 2:
		2 Red
		3 green
		5 blue
	Percentage chance: 3 / 10 = 30%
	
Question 3: WRONG not 677 (THREE NOT TWO PEOPLE)
	How many people would have to watch the live stream of the 2020 Shawnee House Tank Battle,
	to guarantee that at least THREE of the them share the same first and last initials in their real names?
	Just enter the actual numerical value
	26 * 26 = 676 * 2 + 1 = 1,352
	
for n people
	(26 * 26) * n-1 + 1
	
Question 4: WRONG not 1/21
	A bag contains 20 balanced, fair coins. 
	Nineteen of the coins are real, with heads on one side and tails on the other. 
	One of the coins is fake and has heads on both sides.
	
	21 heads,
	19 tails
		
	You reach into the bag, take out a coin at random, and flip heads. The probability that you got the fake coin is
		1 / 21
		
Question 5: RIGHT 1/7
	A certain person has a very messy sock drawer containing a pair of 
	black socks, a pair of blue socks, a pair of green socks, and a pair of white socks. 
	The socks are otherwise identical.

	It is extremely dark and there are no sources of light in the room. 
	The light bulb has blown, the mobile battery is dead, and there are no other lights, candles, or anything to illuminate the drawer. 
	However, this does not change the fact that the person needs a matching pair of socks.

	The person takes one sock from the drawer, puts it on, then gets another and puts it on. 
	What is the probability that the two socks are the same colour?
	
	socks:
		2 black
		2 blue
		2 green
		2 white
	8 socks total
		
	chose 1 sock, chance of getting matching sock is (1 / 7)
	
Question 6: WRONG not (3/8)
	Two identical-looking bowls contain some marbles. 
	Bowl One contains one Red, three Green, and two Blue marbles. 
	Bowl Two contains two Red, three Green, and five Blue marbles. 
	You cannot see into either bowl.

	If we randomly select a bowl then draw one marble at random from that bowl, what is the probability that the marble is Green?
	
	Bowl 1:
		1 Red
		3 Green
		2 Blue
	Green chance 3 / 6
		
	Bowl 2:
		2 Red
		3 Green
		5 Blue
	Green chance 3 / 10
	
	Total Green chance 6 / 16 = 3 / 8 = 37.5% chance
	
Question 7: RIGHT 5
	A certain person has a very messy sock drawer containing 
	ten black socks, eight blue socks, four green socks, and two white socks. 
	The socks are otherwise identical.

	It is extremely dark and there are no sources of light in the room. 
	The light bulb has blown, the mobile battery is dead, and there are no other lights, candles, or anything to illuminate the drawer. 
	However, this does not change the fact that the person needs a matching pair of socks.

	What is the least number of socks that can be taken from the drawer to guarantee that at least two socks of the same colour are chosen? 
	
	Socks:
		10 black
		8 blue
		4 green
		2 white
	24 total socks
	
	5 socks to guarantee at least two socks of the same colour
	
Question 8: WRONG not 0.9
	A bowl contains one Red, three Green, and two Blue marbles. You cannot see into the bowl.
	Drawing marbles with replacement means to draw a marble from the bowl, record its colour, then return it to the bowl before drawing another marble.
	Drawing marbles without replacement means to draw a marble from the bowl, record its colour, then put it to the side before drawing another. 

	If we draw two marbles from Bowl One without replacement, what is the probability that at least one of the two marbles is Green?
	
	Bowl:
		1 Red
		3 Green
		2 Blue
	6 Marbles
	
	1st marble green chance: 3 / 6
	2nd marble green chacne: 2 / 5
	
Question 9: WRONG not 0.86
	A certain person has a very messy sock drawer containing ten black socks, eight blue socks, four green socks, and two white socks. 
	The socks are otherwise identical.

	It is extremely dark and there are no sources of light in the room. 
	The light bulb has blown, the mobile battery is dead, and there are no other lights, candles, or anything to illuminate the drawer. 
	However, this does not change the fact that the person needs a matching pair of socks.

	The person takes one sock from the drawer, puts it on, then gets another and puts it on. 
	Rounded to two decimal places, what is the probability that the two socks are the same colour?
	
	
	Socks:
		10 black
		8 blue
		4 green
		2 white
	24 Total
	
	probability both socks same colour
	
	first pick:
	chance black: 10 / 24 = .416
	chance blue: 8 / 24 = .33
	chance green: 4 / 24 = .16
	chance white: 2 / 24 = .083
	
	second pick:
	chance black: 9 / 23 = .39
	chance blue: 7 / 23 = .304
	chance green: 3 / 23 = .13
	chance white: 1 / 23 = .043
	
Question 10: RIGHT
	A bowl contains one Red, three Green, and two Blue marbles. You cannot see into the bowl.
	Drawing marbles with replacement means to draw a marble from the bowl, record its colour, then return it to the bowl before drawing another marble.
	Drawing marbles without replacement means to draw a marble from the bowl, record its colour, then put it to the side before drawing another. 

	If we draw two marbles from the bowl, which of the following is TRUE?
	
	Marbles:
		1 Red
		3 Green
		2 Blue
		
	with replacement:
		3 / 6
		3 / 6
	probability = .25
		
	without replacement:
		3 / 6
		3 / 5
	probability = .3

 4. The probability of drawing at least one Green marble with replacement  | is LESS than the probability of drawing at least one Green marble without replacement.
